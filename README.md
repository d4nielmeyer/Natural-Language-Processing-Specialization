# Natural-Language-Processing-Specialization
Natural Language Processing (NLP) uses algorithms to understand and manipulate human language. This technology is one of the most broadly applied areas of machine learning. As AI continues to expand, so will the demand for professionals skilled at building models that analyze speech and language, uncover contextual patterns, and produce insights from text and audio.

The course includes 4 chapters covering the following topics:

1) Logistic regression, na√Øve Bayes, and word vectors to implement sentiment analysis, complete analogies, and translate words, and use locality sensitive hashing for approximate nearest neighbors

2) Dynamic programming, hidden Markov models, and word embeddings to autocorrect misspelled words, autocomplete partial sentences, and identify part-of-speech tags for words.

3) Dense and recurrent neural networks, LSTMs, GRUs, and Siamese networks in TensorFlow and Trax to perform advanced sentiment analysis, text generation, named entity recognition, and to identify duplicate questions.

4) Encoder-decoder, causal, and self-attention to perform advanced machine translation of complete sentences, text summarization, question-answering and to build chatbots. Models covered include T5, BERT, transformer, reformer, and more!
